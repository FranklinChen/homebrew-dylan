Dylan for Homebrew
##################

This is the official `Dylan`_ tap for `homebrew`_.

Mac users can use these formulae to easily install and update Open Dylan
and other tools.

Initial setup
=============

If you don't have homebrew, install it from their `homepage`_.

Then, add this tap::

    brew tap dylan-lang/dylan

Installing
==========

To install Open Dylan::

    brew install opendylan

Updating
========

Simply run::

    brew upgrade opendylan

Thanks
======

Thanks for the Dart folks whose README, I largely copied
and for motivating me to get this going for Dylan.
